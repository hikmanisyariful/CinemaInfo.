    plot:
      "With his theatrical company a local success, Buster Moon is dreaming of bigger things. Unfortunately, when a talent scout dismisses their work as inadequate for the big time, Buster is driven to prove her wrong. With that goal in mind, Buster inspires his players to gamble everything to sneak into a talent audition in Redshore City for the demanding entertainment mogul Jimmy Crystal. Against the odds, they catch his interest with some frantic creative improvisation and even more desperate lies like personally knowing the reclusive rock star, Clay Calloway, who has not been seen in 15 years. Now faced with a tight production window with only a vague story idea and dire consequences for failure, Buster and his friends must all stretch their talents put on a show against all odds. In that struggle, the gang's challenges seem insurmountable, but each of them finds new inspirations and friends where they least expect them to pursue an artistic dream worthy of them.",

He decides to take the show on the road to Redshore City. Rosita quits her gig to join them. While struggling in a pitch meeting with entertainment mogul Jimmy Crystal, Gunter suggests a show with legendary rock star Clay Calloway.This starts with a song from Prince and the songs don't end until the final credits. This is a franchise of try-hards and theater geeks. It's fine. It's not my favorite subject matter. The try-hards are continuing to try hard. It's a sequel and more of the same. The original is fine.

        content:
          'The last three movies I saw in theater were real dogs. I won\'t say what they were, but the last one rhymes with "fake tricks." I was in a movie slump, which made me a little apprehensive about "Sing 2." Turns out there was no need to be apprehensive at all, this movie was amazing."Sing 2" had all the old gang minus the mouse. The movie began with a Buster Moon (Matthew McConaughey) production with a big time talent scout from Redshore City in the audience. Redshore City is like a suped up Las Vegas. Moon\'s updated musical version of "Alice in Wonderland" wasn\'t enough to impress the scout, but Moon would not be denied. In his classic hustling fashion he got his theater troupe on the Redshore City stage to secure a full musical, but with one big condition: he\'d need Clay Calloway (Bono) in his production. With a new act, a new member, a missing link, and his life on the line, Moon would need a miracle to make it all happen.I don\'t know why, but I liked "Sing 2" even more than "Sing." The musical numbers, again, were fantastic and the plot was wonderful. All of the characters are easy to like and the music works with the flow of the movie as well as the feel of the movie. Even though the plot is very similar to part one, enough elements were different to make it fresh and thoroughly enjoyable.'

          "Buster Moon's proteges are playing sell-out shows in Buster's theatre, but he has bigger ambitions. He wants success for them in Redstone City, the centre of shiwbiz despite being refused an audition, he manages to blag his way into a big budget show for them, but paints himself into several corners in the process, not least of which is extreme danger from Mr Crystal, who commissioned the show. So, while production is under way, moves are afoot to find Clay Calloway, the star Buster has promised. The only thing is that no-one has seen Calloway for 15 years...My first reaction was that I've forgotten the characters and why I should care about them. But the opening number was such a firecracker that I was immediately caught up in the main story and its various subplots, and remained so until the end. So I simply offer several thoughts (among many):1. The musical sequences are terrific; 2. I loved Nooshy the breakdancing cat, and the whole Johnny dancing subplot; 3. I'm not a fan of Bono, but he gave a terrific performance as Clay Calloway; 4. Halsey (who?) as Crystal's daughter Porsha was a hoot. I was thinking Lina Lamont; 5. There were a number of moments when I choked and my eyes prickled.Recommended."

        title: "yellow brick road",
        content:
          "Greetings again from the darkness. When an animated movie for kids banks over $600 million at the box office, we wouldn't expect 5 years to pass before the sequel appears. But that's exactly what has occurred with writer-director Garth Jennings' follow-up to his hugely popular 2016 original featuring a troupe of anthropomorphic animals singing and dancing. This franchise doesn't belong to Pixar or Disney, but rather Illumination, the studio behind the DESPICABLE ME films.As one would expect, the sequel includes a return of the favorite characters (and voices), including koala Buster Moon (Matthew McConaughey), mama pig Rosita (Reese Witherspoon), rockin' porcupine Ash (Scarlett Johansson), shy elephant Meena (Tori Kelly), and sensitive gorilla Johnny (Taron Egerton). The stakes are higher for our warbling friends this time. The film opens with our furry friends performing an \"Alice in Wonderland\" production that features the Prince song, \"Let's Go Crazy\". Additionally, our retinas are scorched with every color known to mankind, reminding us of the land Oz ... fitting because song #2 is Elton John's \"Goodbye, Yellow Brick Road\". The latter works because Buster has just been informed by talent scout Suki (Chelsea Peretti) that his team is 'cute', but \"not good enough\". See, Buster's dream is to introduce the act on a global scale.Most of the rest of the movie involves: Buster dodging threats from evil tycoon Mr. Crystal (Bobby Cannavale). Crystal is a wolf (of course) and is a powerful presence in a Las Vegas-style city built for entertainment. The other key element here is Buster's promise to Crystal to deliver Clay Callaway (U2's Bono) to the new production. Callaway, a lion, has been a reclusive rock star ever since a personal tragedy robbed him of his desire to participate in society. The bonding between Ash and Callaway is probably the best part of the story, and this occurs after Ash (Ms. Johansson) makes her point about equal pay (imitating real life) just after jamming to a Yeah, Yeah, Yeahs' song.In a move that makes little sense, Mr. Jennings has crafted a more complex story than what we saw in the first movie. This one will be difficult for many kids to follow, and involves the power and ego of Crystal, as well as nepotism with his entitled daughter (voiced beautifully by Halsey). But why complicate something that doesn't need to be more complicated? Most kids just want to watch the animals on stage, singing and dancing and doing goofy things. The sci-fi stage production \"Out of this World\" finds Meena teamed with a preening partner voiced by Eric Andre, while she dreams of connecting with the ice cream elephant voiced by Pharell Williams. Ash and Callaway are at the climax of the show with a version of Bono's \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\". Also included are many familiar tunes by such artists as Taylor Swift, Shawn Mendes, Billie Eilish, and The Weeknd. Many life lessons are served up here, including the importance of following your dream, but at one hour and fifty-two minutes, it's easily 20 to 25 minutes longer than most kids will likely sit. While we can admire Mr. Jennings' desire to deliver a sequel with value, we do question the wisdom in revising the template.Opens in theaters on December 22, 2021."

          "I was pleasantly surprised to see that Sing 2 was better than the original. Although I didn't have an extremely high opinion of the first film, this sequel took the same elements and really blew me away. All the characters are true to their personalities and develop more as they confront challenges on a larger scale than ever before. Tired of being overlooked, the ever ambitious Buster Moon cheats his way into the dazzling Redford City and wins over Crystal and his daughter... for as long as he can! The rest of the cast find they're not what it takes, as Suki had warned them, but they force themselves to make the show work, no matter what. Throughout this film we get many new characters and some returning ones, which does mess up the flow of the film and makes the plot feel choppy at times, but it all comes together at the end."

          "Sing 2 (2021) is a movie my wife and I recently watched in theatres. The storyline follows the gang from the first film performing together in the same theatre and not making it big time as they hoped. They decide to pack up and head to Vegas for an audition for a show on the strip. They win the audition but in doing so promised a star for the show who has long since retired. As the gang gets ready for their big act they will need to try and convince a star who has been out of the industry for 15 years to return to performing.This movie is directed by Garth Jennings (Sing) and contains the voices of Matthew McConaughey (Mud), Reese Witherspoon (Legally Blond), Scarlett Johansson (Avengers), Tara Strong (Power Puff Girls), Jason Schwartzman (Moonrise Kingdom) and Nick Kroll (Sausage Party).The movie starts with a bang with a fantastic rendition of Alice and Wonderland and is brilliant from there. The audition sequence in this is hilarious. The ending show is very well done and fun to watch unfold. They did a great job of not tipping off the final performance to the audience. The song selection is awesome and the portrayal of the characters is excellent. The animation is some of the best I've ever seen. The storyline unfolds well but predictably and the villain is perfectly intense.Overall this is a very well done movie that is a perfect follow-up to the first movie with a well thought-out plot and good use of characters. I would score this an 8.5/10 and strongly recommend it."

There are plenty of singing, dancing, and hit songs. The script is easy to follow, the characters are funny and the movie isn't slogged down with any politics, sex or drugs. It's just fun entertainment, the way a movie should be made."

But when Buster and Ash(Johanson) track Cal down they discover that he is now a recluse and doesn't want to sing nor play anymore. Will Buster persuade Cal to star in the new show?.Overall I enjoyed this film as its got great songs from current acts like Camila Cabello,Shawn Mendes,Ariana Grande,Coldplay and U2. If you loved the 1st film then you will enjoy this feelgood film. Bono surprised me in this film as it was his first acting gig as well as his animated debut He was very good in this film.B +"

Matthew is the manager of the group-all animals, for those who may have forgotten-that take turns singing the songs while trying to put on their musical. Scarlett and Ash are a couple of the members and Bobby is the owner of a big casino where Matthew and company wish to perform but Bobby wants a big name to be in the show, such as a legend like Bono, who has been out of the business for 15 years. The only problem is that Bono doesn't want to perform, for personal reasons. Can he be persuaded? What do you think?It's rated PG for some rude material and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 50 minutes.Like I said, it is entertaining and I enjoyed it enough that I would buy it on DVD."

Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the arguing scene, overuse of the calling names scene, overuse of the blackout scene, overuse of the song playing at the background scene, overuse of the talking on the phone scene, overuse of the drinking scene, overuse of the rehearsing scene, overuse of the playing dumb scene, overuse of the driving scene, and overuse of the tripping scene! Make the film unwatchable! At the end, Calloway agree to perform at The Majestic Palace with Buster Moon\'s crew! That\'s it! Another disappointed film!'

        content:
          "The sequel to the 2016 original is more of the traditional 'Little Rascals/let's put on a show' as our intrepid promoter, voiced by Matthew McConaughey's Buster Moon, has hopes of taking his mildly successful local show to the big leagues; a Las Vegas like residency but after the scout is not overly impressed by their little show, Moon decides to gather the troops anyway to hopefully crash an audition. Getting his foot in the door, Moon bluffs his way to the show's backer, voiced by Bobby Cannavale, he can produce a reclusive singer, voiced by Bono, out of hiding to participate in their new production; a sci-fi travelogue created by Gunther, Nick Kroll but there is one caveat, Cannavale wants his daughter, singer Halsey, in the show so off the movie goes as the various cast members have their tasks to do interspersed w/warbling of recent hits keeping the well rendered visuals a delight & even though it's not to the story caliber of say Pixar films, they nonetheless still entertain a whole bunch."

        title: "Time 2 Sing",
        content:
          "LIKES:The Animation: DreamWorks may not break the ground that Disney does with the CGI work they do, but it still does impress this reviewer with how gorgeous they make the world of Sing. The popping colors of various set pieces are full of that hopeful energy, perfect for an entertaining movie and keeping your eyes in wonder at the fun to be had. Yet, at the same time, there is a \"darker\" side to things, which are a work of beauty on its own to help paint the mood and add on to the work of the voice actors. As for movement, it is smooth, great transitions, and filled with that same pizazz the first installment did in the dance and singing moments, alongside the natural movements of the characters. The whole design of the world is a great blend of human merging with animal, and the copying of our architecture and it just makes for a wonderful setting.The Voice Acting: Sing 2 has acquired quite a cast to bring the group to life, which is always worrisome when it comes to using them to their complete potential. Sing 2 fortunately does an okay job with that and the actors get props for their performances once more. Buster Moon, our loveable koala, has the same hopeful tone McConaughey infused in the last film, adding a bit more stubbornness and focus now that he has been established. Witherspoon feels like a natural again in her role, and nails the performance of the mother and nervous star attempting to go the next level, adding care, charisma, and of course the acting chops she has shown in movies like Home Again. Johansson is the one with a little more diversity than anyone as Ash, who goes a little more into both sides of the spectrum from the Rockstar jamming youth, to an old spirit wise animal, who manages to intelligently keep things together. Yet the winners for my favorite performances are Nick Kroll, Bobby Cannavale, and Garth Jennings. Kroll as Gunter is sensational, he's the energy and ridiculous, peppy pig, with the lines that are the most memorable and they have taken the foundation and elevated him further to be my particularly favorite character. Cannavale plays the wolf, and much like other films where he adds the villain tone, he injects the tone of the antagonist quite well without diving too far down the rabbit hole of evil. He was arrogant and an egomaniac, typical of a businessman with everything, and it fit into the world well, allowing him to bare his teeth more as the movie progressed. I think he nailed the character to the best degree and I certainly give him props for making a good kids' movie villain. As for Jennings, the director as the voice of the female chameleon continues to be another awesome performance in mannerisms, comedy, and heart given the scenes that Ms. Crawly takes on in this film.The Heart: Sing took a concept of American Idol with animals, and managed to go deeper into the soul and heart of humans to inspire as it approached the ending. In Sing 2, the story takes another deeper step down that road and manages to do a glorious job of getting you teary eyed/smiling at the wonder to be hold. There are a lot of subplots in this story, using a wide variety of characters as they are forced to balance, analyze, and address the problems they are facing. For this reviewer, they managed to tug some heart strings very well, and once again inspire to do better and open my mind to new possibilities. Sing 2 is certain to hit a lot of the target audience the same way, and depending on the age and makeup of your kid, might just dig deep into them as well and get them to be excited about things to come. It's the quality core component of the family aspect of this film, and I don't think many will be disappointed by the direction they took.The Performances/Music: Let's face it, with a title like Sing as your franchise, you know a heavy element is the music that has been purchased/created for this film. Once again Illumination Studios has done a great job of acquiring a diversity of songs to sing in their list, and have integrated both original and covers of the song to help get the earworm going. Unlike several other franchises though, they manage to maximize most of their songs into the plot and give more purpose and meaning to their inclusion then simply just shoving them in the movie. Jennings and his music team really hit their A game for me, finding the right placements of songs in the non-performance moments to help elevate the emotion to new levels, and giving us a great cover to boot. Yet, it's the performance moments that really pizazz and become the hybrid of movie and stage show that was always promised in the original movie. Sing 2 gives us amazing numbers to the unorthodox Sci-Fi Stage show, and is really the crown jewel that climactically finishes this heartwarming tale. I loved the ending so much for many reasons and feel that this will be a lot of audience members' favorite moments when they hit this film. This part is definitely worthy of theater level viewing, and if you got the guts for 3-D, I think it helped to be honest.DISLIKES: The Plot: It's a kids' film and I get things have to be a bit lighter to not bore the hyper energy kiddos that will be the primary target. However, Sing, Madagascar, and Despicable Me have all proven that you can layer a plot and still be good. Sing 2 started to do this, but I don't think it reached the full potential that it was going for. Outside of predictability, the movie seems sort of lost in which aspects to work through, giving a timetable that makes for rushed moments and impasses that are hurdles a bit too quickly. That level of integration in the first film is only a sliver, perhaps due to focus on the ending, or perhaps due to pandemic cutting into time and budget. Either way, the plot is complete, but without the solid ending may have suffered more given the integration issues.The Character Usage/Growth: Sing 2 already had a heavy cast to begin with, but they added more to the mix to try for expansion and it was decent and fun. However, like the plot, the character growth, focus, and abilities are a bit blander than I had hoped given the advertising for this movie. It's a fast paced juggle, going from subplot to subplot in rapid manner and never giving us the time, focus, and energy to really see them work past the fears and limitations plaguing them. Many of the moments are to one scene, or a quick montage that offers little backstory, bonding, and trust that we saw in that first film. Things are again too sewn together in that Playhouse Disney sort of way, and for older audience members like me seeing those moments helps add spectacle to the film. Again, it's not the worst suspense of disbelief, but something more was needed to help spread and balance the stories and songs that I was looking for.The Advertising: This is one of those major cases where commercials went way too far to give you the movie, as they gave you almost the entire movie. Sing 2's commercials showed way too much, and offered little surprise or twists that this movie could have used super well. I'm guessing that from what I've seen in trailers, you have about 60-65% of the movie already for viewing, with only the stage show offering any incentive to still see it. Sing 2's advertisement aggressiveness may have ruined more of the film than any other aspect, just because I had pieced the entire thing together from the bits and pieces they gave in their 2-3 minute ads for about 10 ads. That is indeed the biggest weakness for me in this film, so if you have avoided the commercials... good job and this will be a moot point.The VERDICT: Sing 2 is a great sequel in terms of entertainment, teaching, design, and spectacle when it comes to animated movies. It has heart, it has energy, and it really builds off the base of the first movie in the goal to give something new, while respecting the traditions. The voice acting is fun, with the new voices finding a welcome home in the big animal city, while the new world is clever in its portrayal of our world. It really is the music and performances that are the selling point though, and for this reviewer the backbone of why you should hit the theater to check this film out. Limitation wise though, I don't think the movie did quite the best work when it came to character and time management, taking a fast track approach and really sidestepping the true potential of the soulful moments the first film did so well. The movie may have been too hopeful in its inclusion of voices and characters and needed another half an hour to reach the same level of quality the first one did. However, the worst part is the aggressive advertisements that have given much of the movie away and if you can avoid this, well then you are in good shape and should be god, but otherwise you know most of the movie from watching those alone. My scores for Sing 2 are:Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0."

          "Sing 2Worth watching!After Sing 1 we all knew that this would be an impossible act to follow, however this sequel more than stands up to scrutiny.Mr Moon decides the only way is up for his musical talent and goes for broke trying to earn them a musical spot in Vegas. Following a negative review from a talent spotter our bunch of musical heroes decide to \"con\" their way into the big time.Gunter creates a bizarre musical production that pivots on them enlisting a famous, but retired, musician to pull the crowd in.As an aside it was a cautious plot development but brave in making a sequel at all. The nature of Hollywood is caution embodied, people invest to make money and a sure fire hit is the way to go.The songs were largely forgettable, which is a shame, I missed Mike, Mr Moon's flaky friend who brought much humour. It was overly frenetic and a little predictable. But with that said there were some wonderful set pieces, Matthew McConaughy nails it and all the voice over stars were great.It won't win an Oscar but it a firm 7 outta 10 from me, meaning if you enjoyed the first movie you will certainly enjoy this."

          "Sing out of this world.While the first one had a more down-to-earth story and a surprisingly good amount of payoff at the end, this sequel lacked both. Both movies only had a superficial layer of theme, but this one was almost impossible to relate to. Some parts were a bit outlandish.Pretty much the only thing it did better and the only thing that made it enjoyable was the fantastic animation. The final showdown at the end, while had low payoff values, was significantly more colorful and fun than the first.Overall, it just a silly movie with some laugh, but it wasn't closed to the good feeling that the first one gave. 5.5/10."

They try to persuade the notoriously private rock music icon, Clay Calloway(Bono), to sing with them for a new musical, they're staging.Sing 2 is a fun film. Director Garth Jennings has retained the feel-good spirit of Sing(2016) & of course lots of new foot-tapping songs sung by our favorite stars. The original music by U2 lead singer Bono, is fantastic. The cast's voice-overs & their singing, is the highlight of the movie. Matthew McConaughey is brilliant as Buster Moon. Reese Witherspoon is spectacular as Rosita. Scarlett Johansson is fantastic as Ash. Tori Kelly is outstanding as Meena. Taron Egerton is phenomenal as Johnny. Bobby Cannavale is perfect as Mr. Crystal. Bono is excellent as Clay Calloway. The supporting cast is unforgettable. Sing 2 is a must watch, with your entire family. Go & singalong with your favorite characters."

It had great voice acting, great characters, good songs, great musical numbers, and pretty animation.So, I wasn't expecting much in the sequel. But, after watching I found it was just as good as the first movie.Sing 2 (2021) was really entertaining. The characters are voiced well by the same great voice cast and I thought they were also funny.There were scenes I didn't expect, and they were funny especially when there are serious moments, then they are surprising.The songs are good, and the voice actors can sing well, along with great choreographed dance numbers. The animation is pretty and has improved since the first movie.I think Illumination animation is really good and they've done great movies, like Despicable Me. The 3rd act was surprising and the final performance is nicely staged with great songs.When the 3rd act starts, I start liking the movie even more while it keeps surprising me with unexpected scenes. I really do suggest watching Sing 2 (2021), but only if you liked the first one.I really think you will laugh and will be really entertained in how it plays out."
